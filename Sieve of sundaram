In a futuristic city, Prime City, only residents with prime-numbered ID cards are allowed access to the city's high-security zones. The city uses an AI-based system that generates a list of prime ID numbers less than a given threshold using the Sieve of Sundaram algorithm.

The security department is upgrading the system and needs a tool that generates all prime ID numbers less than or equal to a given number N using the Sieve of Sundaram.

Your task is to help build this tool by writing a program that applies the Sieve of Sundaram technique to generate all such prime numbers.

Input format :
The first line of input contains an integer N,where N is the maximum limit for the prime ID numbers to be generated.

Output format :
The output prints all prime numbers less than or equal to N, in ascending order, separated by a space.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ N ≤ 106

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
2
Output 1 :
2 
Input 2 :
10
Output 2 :
2 3 5 7 

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int n; //20
    cin>>n;
    int num=n/2;// 10
    vector<bool> mark(num+1,false);
    for(int i=1; i<=num; i++) {
        for(int j=i; i+j+2*i*j<=num; j++) {
            mark[i+j+2*j*i]=true;
        }
    }
    cout<<2<<" ";
    for(int i=1; i<=num; i++) {
        if(!mark[i] && i*2+1<=n){
            cout<<i*2+1<<" ";
        }
    }
}
