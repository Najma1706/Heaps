Problem Statement
In a warehouse inventory system, a supervisor must manage the weights of parcels arriving at the facility. Each parcel weight is a positive integer. To efficiently prioritize lighter parcels, the supervisor uses a Min Heap to store the weights. Additionally, the supervisor must calculate the average weight of all parcels and display it with two decimal precision.



Write a program to assist the supervisor with the following tasks:

Accept an integer n, representing the total number of parcels.
For each parcel, process its weight. If the weight is a positive integer, add it to the Min Heap and update the total weight sum.
Display the contents of the Min Heap after all valid weights have been added.
Calculate and display the average weight of the parcels, formatted to two decimal places. If no valid weights are provided, output "No valid weight".
Input format :
The first line contains an integer n, representing the number of parcels.

The second line contains n space-separated integers, representing the weights of the parcels.

Output format :
The first line prints the elements of the Min Heap, separated by spaces.

The second line displays the average weight of the parcels as a double value, formatted to two decimal places.

If no valid weights are provided, output "No valid weight".



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ n ≤ 10

1 ≤ parcel weights ≤ 50
